I strive to represent my Latin community within professional sciences promoting our recognition and inclusion within historically underrepresented fields and advocating for diverse perspectives within academia.\nAs a Member of the Federal Ronald E.

Aggregation behavior is common in these species to increase fitness and survival in low population densities, yet little is known about what habitat features facilitate viable aggregation sizes.\nThe projects in Marine Ecology Course at CSU- Monterey Bay conducted invertebrate swaths and quadrat percent coverage data collected along transects from five rocky intertidal sites along the bay. Historic data spanning from 2002 to 2025 was used to asses environmental drivers of black abalone aggregations.\nAggregations were categorized “successful” if they contained four or more individuals as this was stated within existing literature to contribute to reproductive success. Competitive purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) densities was measured to assess their influence on abalone aggregation sizes."

    "text": "Data Cleaning\nThe amalgamation of data from 2002 to 2025 created challenges in data uniformity. Site, Species, and excess variables were cleaned ensuring comparisons between sites surveys were possible in all years of surveying.\nWe determined abalone aggregation sizes as the sum of abalones within a meter position of each other along an individual transect. An aggregations size variable was created by matching the site, date, transect number,and position (rounded to the nearest meter) of each abalone surveyed. Viable abalone aggregation presence was assessed creating a binary presence variable for —aggregations with more than four abalones considered as “yes” having aggregations present, while aggregations with fewer than four abalones considered as “no” viable aggregation present.\nUrchin density was calculated as the number of urchins witnessed per transect divided by the area of the transect.To determining transect area the transect lengths recorded were multiplied by 2 for 1 meter swaths conducted on each side of the transects (following the parameters set by researchers)."

Aggregations, or groupings of abalone, were categorized as either 4 or more abalone or fewer than 4 abalone. Previous studies have found that aggregations of at least 4 abalones are needed to have a beneficial impact on survival.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf 1,972 abalones found, 115 were found at Cannery Row, 966 were found at Carmel Point, 210 were found at Hopkins Marine Station, 328 were found at Point Pinos, and 353 were found at Soberanes."

Distinct colors represent Cannery Row, Carmel Pt, Hopkins, Pt Pinos, and Soberanes survey sites along the Monterey Peninsula. There does not seem to be a strong relationship between sea urchin density and abalone aggregation size although a slight negative trend seems possible. A negtaive realtaionship between aggregation sizes and purple urchin density would make sense as both of these organisms compete for the same food and habiatat. Therfore with increasing urchin densities this could be outcompeting already volnurable abalone populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation sizes and density were only considered if they appeared on corresponding dates and transects, with 347 comparisons modeled"
