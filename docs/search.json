As an ecologist, I will study the manner ecological relations between environmental conditions, invertebrates, and habitat-building organisms will be affected particularly within the remaining fragile kelp forest ecosystem.\nMy combined Colombian and American values afford me bilingualism and familiarity with individuals of diverse heritages broadening my ability to connect with peers within the scientific community. I strive to represent my Latin community within professional sciences promoting our recognition and inclusion within historically underrepresented fields and advocating for diverse perspectives within academia.\nAs a Member of the Federal Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program I am ​working to develop my research capabilities mentored by Dr. Cheryl Logan and Dr. Lydia Baker at CSU Monterey Bay.\nObtaining a professional Dive Master certification I support students’ success in SCUBA classes of varying levels, with over 200 hours of instruction"

    "text": "Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) are an ecologically and culturally important species found in the rocky intertidal, that have experienced severe population declines due to overharvesting and predation. Aggregation behavior is common in these species to increase fitness and survival in low population densities, yet little is known about what habitat features facilitate viable aggregation sizes.\nThe projects in Marine Ecology Course at CSU- Monterey Bay conducted invertebrate swaths and quadrat percent coverage data collected along transects from five rocky intertidal sites along the bay. Historic data spanning from 2002 to 2025 was used to asses environmental drivers of black abalone aggregations.\nAggregations were categorized “successful” if they contained four or more individuals as this was stated within existing literature to contribute to reproductive success. Competitive purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) densities was measured to assess their influence on abalone aggregation sizes."

An aggregations size variable was created by matching the site, date, transect number,and position (rounded to the nearest meter) of each abalone surveyed. Viable abalone aggregation presence was assessed creating a binary presence variable for —aggregations with more than four abalones considered as “yes” having aggregations present, while aggregations with fewer than four abalones considered as “no” viable aggregation present.\nUrchin density was calculated as the number of urchins witnessed per transect divided by the area of the transect.To determining transect area the transect lengths recorded were multiplied by 2 for 1 meter swaths conducted on each side of the transects (following the parameters set by researchers)."
